# TO WHAT EXTENT TO YOU COMPLY WITH GDPR?

## Short Answer
As we are not incorporated, nor do we have employees, within the European Union we are not required by anyone who has legal authority over us to comply with GDPR.

## Apology for the rest
We're a bit tired of the unusual frequency of people approaching us on this subject with extremely nasty attitudes. We're talking full blown "Karen from Arkansas at Walmart" kind of nasty. Forgive us, but we're going to settle that here and we won't talk about it again unless something changes. One document to rule them all. We're not kidding, this is a huge problem for us. Trolls come out of the woodwork to harass us on this topic with what can only be described as religious fervor. The rest of this document is in the form of a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). Question, in the voice of the troll, and answer.

## "But the GDPR says you have to follow it!"
You don't have to follow a law passed in South Korea, and we don't have to follow a law passed by the European Union. The text of that law does not change this. Jurisdictions and borders are not matters of preference, they are absolute legal constructs.

## "Does this mean you don't care about privacy?"
Of course not. Just because a bunch of wealthy men in suits gathered together in one part of the world and declared that they are the authority on the subject does not mean that anyone not following their lead doesn't care about the subject matter. That's ridiculous. We happen to think we care about user privacy more than the EU does, but you're welcome to your opinion.

## "You're just a rebel and you'll be held accountable."
Send troops or get a treaty. This is how you enforce law outside of your borders.

## "Does this mean you don't want European customers?"
Absolutely not. It is not illegal in our jurisdiction to provide services to you from afar. If it is illegal for you to do business with us, that is another topic entirely, and one we're not experts on.

## "I'm a laywer and I know more than you, and you're wrong about all of this"
Well then we'll see you in court. Good luck.

## "I hate you!"
K

## "Why would a business talk this way!?"
Why would people who aren't even customers routinely take out their anger on us in such an obscene fashion that we deemed this necessary? I don't know. I suspect that 2020 caused a lot of frustration and people are just looking for fights everywhere they go. I understand that some people genuinely do prefer representatives of business entities to role play as robots or as political PR types, MXroute is run by humans and we're not into roleplay.

## "Do people really approach you and angrily accuse you of things regarding GDPR?"
I call them GDPR Trolls. It's a type of person I've identified across the internet. I propose that they are not concerned with privacy or security at all. Rather, I propose that they suffer from stress caused by an inbalanced power dynamic somewhere in their life. This causes them to desire the ability to express power and control over others. For them, GDPR is a perfect example for them to wield a weapon against strangers for the sole purpose of exercising their perceived power over them. They like to harass strangers for no reason, they argue for no gain whatsoever. They are a new form of troll, and not a particularly entertaining one. Their anger over not being able to control us with this law is painfully apparent in public discussion spaces, but they won't bully us into anything.
