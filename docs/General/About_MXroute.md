# ABOUT MXROUTE

MXroute is a “bring your own domain” e-mail service. You provide the domain, we provide service for inbound and outbound e-mail. We provide a strong focus on outbound e-mail delivery, with an adequate (if not above average) focus on inbound e-mail delivery. Our philosophy is that anyone can run an inbound mail server, but getting your e-mail delivered to Gmail, Hotmail, Verizon, AT&T, and Yahoo from one IP address is almost a fantasy.

### Provided Services
SMTP, POP3, IMAP, Webmail (Roundcube, Rainloop, Crossbox), Control Panel (DirectAdmin-based)

### Privacy
We are committed to protecting your data in a standard fashion. The only time we arguably share data would be when you order service, your basic information is turned into a hash and searched against fraudrecord.com to ensure that you haven’t been reported for fraudulent activity by reputable service providers.

We do not go out of our way to ensure that we do not have the ability to access your data, as is the standard (and should always be assumed of any service unless clearly otherwise stated). With that said, we are bound by certain legal principles that benefit us most by not accessing the data you store with us (plausible deniability, or “safe harbor”). We monitor and audit our systems regularly, keeping up with known vulnerabilites in open source software and patching or mitigating them immediately.

### Who is MXroute?
MXroute is the product of Jarland Donnell. As a system administrator at HostGator in 2013, Jarland saw a pretty clear picture that customers just wanted email that worked. They didn’t want excuses on why an email didn’t reach it’s recipient, explanations of IP reputation or neighboring spammers, or to understand why Yahoo implemented DMARC. They just wanted the emails to reach their destination. At the time, Jarland saw a need and set out to fill it by building MXroute.

In 2019, MXroute became an official legal entity in the state of Texas, MXroute LLC. MXroute remains a family business managed by Jarland and Christine Donnell.

In 2020, due to rapid growth, MXroute hired its first full time dedicated employee, Jarland.

### How can I trust a small business?
Sometimes we hear about customers who say “You’re too small to be able to provide us with the production services we need.” We see this as an absolute fallacy of logic. Sometimes they’ll dig through our years of success and find one or two instances of a mistake, then judge us accordingly as though similar or worst mistakes do not occur in larger organizations. If you haven’t seen large companies fail then you haven’t been paying attention. Here’s a few things you probably missed:

[VC funded DigitalOcean with hundreds of employees goes down due to mistake that drops the customer database in 2017.](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/update-on-the-april-5th-2017-outage/)

[Hackers steal $71,000 in bitcoin from Linode in 2012 by obtaining admin passwords for networking gear.](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/hackers/web-host-linode-hacked-71000-stolen.html)

[Gmail goes down for thousands of users in April of 2020.](https://www.newsweek.com/gmail-down-wednesday-april-8-1496877)

[Hotmail/Outlook goes down due to overheating servers in 2013.](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2030836/microsoft-blames-outlook-hotmail-outage-on-overheated-servers-apologizes.html)

Those are just a few, and we’re not judging those companies for their failures. Chances are you aren’t either. So why then would you put higher standards on us? Show us a company incapable of mistakes and we’ll show you a company that isn’t too big to fail, but one that either isn’t as transparent or has no customers to see them fail.
