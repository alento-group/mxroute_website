# BRANDING CROSSBOX

You can completely brand Crossbox to fit your own needs, for yourself and your customers, friends, family, etc. You’ll have your own login URL, your own name for it, and your own logo. Here’s a quick guide to setting that up.

## Step 1: Create admin
First you need to create an admin@ account on your domain. You can find a guide for creating an email account at this link.

## Step 2: Login to Crossbox
You can log in at [https://mail.mxlogin.com](https://mail.mxlogin.com). Log in with the admin@ account you created in step 1.

## Step 3: Go to branding settings
On the left is a menu. Scroll down until you see Admin. Click on that, and then click on Branding. When there, you’ll see an empty form like this:

## Step 4: Figure out URL
What do you want your login URL to be? For me, and in my example, I chose crossbox.jarland.net. You can choose anything you want here. Think about it, and then add it to your DNS as a CNAME record pointing to mail.mxlogin.com. In my example, I used Porkbun for the DNS, so it looked like this:

## Step 5: Fill out the form
Fill out the form as desired. Here’s a look at what mine looked like when I finished it:

## Step 6: Add Logo
You’ll need to upload a logo that is at least 1024×1024. Scroll down on that form and you’ll find the place to upload it:

You can edit a lot of other things on this page too, feel free.

## Step 7: Save changes
Click SAVE in the top right corner of the page when you’re done.

## Step 8: Pending
You’ll notice now that your branding is pending. You’ll see something like this:

## Step 9: Finished
When it’s complete, you’ll get an email to that same admin@ account you’re logged in with. It’ll look like this:

You’re done! Visit the URL you picked, and enjoy!
