## Add MX Records
Note that the records used in this example need to match the ones you located in the previous step, not necessarily the ones we used in the example.

## Add DKIM Record
Note in the video below that we removed the quotations at the beginning and the end. This is because Cloudflare automatically adds them, and leaving them results in two sets of them which breaks DKIM. Also note that the name is always:

`x._domainkey`
