## Read First
Several parts of this document are animated GIFs showing how to accomplish a task. When you scroll to them, you may be viewing them from the middle or end. Watch through them to see them start over.

## Find DNS Records
**Step 1**: Log in to Route53  
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones#](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones#)

**Step 2**: Locate and click on your domain

## Delete Old MX Records
Put a check in the box next to the current MX records, then click Delete. You can easily locate it by typing “Type: MX” in the filter/search box above the DNS records.

## Add MX Records
Note that the records used in this example need to match the ones you located in the previous step, not necessarily the ones we used in the example.

**IMPORTANT: Notice we pick somewhere relatively in the middle of the string to add two quotation signs. This is understood by Route53 as splitting the record into two. Your position doesn’t have to be exact, it’s just that the string is too long by default for the DNS editor at Route53, and it needs to be split up to fit.**
