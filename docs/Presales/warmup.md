# Can I use a warmup service?

No. Warmup services advertise themselves as improving inbox delivery by sending automated emails from your domain to the major email providers, reporting them as not spam, and "training" those services to see your domain as having a positive reputation. Think, for one moment, about what that means. That means you are maliciously attacking their spam filtering systems with the intent to manipulate them through a method that is anything but organic.

Microsoft agrees that this behavior is shady, as does anyone registering a minimal amount of brain activity. Don't take my word for it, they sued Boris Mizhen for exactly this behavior: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/06/microsoft-sues-spammers-for-abusing-hotmail-anti-spam-filters/

Our expectation is that if we allow customers to do this, the major email providers will catch on to what is happening and will retaliate in kind by giving all of our customers the spam folder treatment, and/or blocking our whole email service. Because we deeply care about our customers and their ability to use the service we paid for, we will absolutely NOT tolerate you trying to destroy our service and the reputation of our customers. If you use a warmup service on MXroute, you will be suspended immediately. If you don't agree to stop right then, you'll be terminated without recourse.
