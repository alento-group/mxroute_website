# ARE STORAGE LIMITS PER EMAIL ACCOUNT OR FOR THE WHOLE ACCOUNT?

Each order of service is an account on one of our servers. Each account is allocated an amount of storage. How you allocate that storage is entirely up to you, and you can even over allocate it. The only limitation in play here is the total amount of storage physically utilized by the entirety of that account, no matter what combination or number of email accounts utilize the storage space.
