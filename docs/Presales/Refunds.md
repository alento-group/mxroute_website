# Why don’t you offer refunds?

This will feel like a bit of a hostile post, and apologies are in order for that. However, we’re trying to do everything we can to prevent a specific customer interaction. While the customer asking for a refund feels unique and individual, we see them as part of a repeat pattern that we can’t break out of, no matter how many steps we take. MXroute is a small business that puts food on the table for a family. Every refund effectively means we had to pay for someone to test our service because transaction fees are a net negative. We don’t want to pay for people to test our service. We actively want people to walk away and not sign up if they want to test our service and ask for a refund later. We actively want people who seeks refunds to go tell their friends “Watch out, they don’t offer refunds.” Our desire is to completely avoid that interaction.

Yet, still, we receive almost daily refund requests by someone who says things like this:

- You don’t offer support, I didn’t know that

- You don’t have any guides or tutorials on how to get started

- You didn’t make a reasonable effort to let me know that you don’t offer refunds

They say all of this after clicking “Support” at the top of our page to find their way to our support chat, or by reply to an email that outlined how to use our service. We've gone to great lengths to make sure you know how to use our product, what kind of support we offer, and our refund policy. If you moved beyond all of this and concluded that we don’t offer support, documentation, or clarity on our no refund policy, is there any way that we can possibly ever have prevented this interaction? We submit that there is not. There are outliers who will brute force their way through our ordering system, ignore every bit of text along the way (we assume automatically filling in the order form), and still end up unaware of any of what they’ve bypassed.

## Please do not sign up for MXroute if your intention is to test our product and ask for a refund.
